# FIU Capstone Team Document Manager

A centralized hub for managing capstone project documents, assignments, and team resources with role-based access control.

## üéØ Why This Exists

Built to solve **team organization chaos**. As our FIU Capstone team grew, we were drowning in:
- Scattered documents across Google Drive, Slack, and email
- Lost assignment deadlines and submission links  
- Confusion about what's done vs. in-progress
- No central place for project resources

This app gives us **one organized hub** where everyone knows exactly what needs to be done, when it's due, and where to find everything.
